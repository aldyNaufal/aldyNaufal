### 📌 Featured Projects

#### 1\. 🎬 CineMatch — Personalized Movie Recommendations with Deep Learning

📌 **GitHub**: [aldyNaufal/movie-recommendation-system](https://github.com/aldyNaufal/movie-recommendation-system)

Engineered a personalized movie recommendation system using **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)** in TensorFlow. The model integrates user-item embeddings with rich metadata (release year, average rating) to generate highly relevant suggestions. It was rigorously evaluated using **RMSE, MAE, R²,** and Pearson/Spearman correlations to ensure accuracy, making it a perfect fit for modern OTT platforms like Netflix.

#### 2\. 🌄 Natural Scene Image Classification with TensorFlow

📌 **GitHub**: [aldyNaufal/image\_classification\_intel](https://github.com/aldyNaufal/image_classification_intel)

Built and trained a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify natural scenes from a dataset of over 20,000 images. The final model was optimized and exported into multiple production-ready formats (**SavedModel, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow.js**), enabling versatile, cross-platform deployment on web, mobile, and edge devices.

#### 3\. 🍲 Deep Learning Recipe Recommender (Indonesian Cuisine Focus)

📌 **GitHub**: [aldyNaufal/recipe-recommendation-system](https://github.com/aldyNaufal/recipe-recommendation-system)

Designed a personalized recipe recommendation system with a unique focus on Indonesian cuisine. This project leverages **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)** to understand user preferences from interaction history. The trained Keras model is served via a scalable **Flask REST API**, enabling real-time inference and seamless integration into any web or mobile frontend. The modular architecture emphasizes scalability for culinary platforms aiming to enhance user engagement through localized recommendations.
